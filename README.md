We have been wanting to experiment with remote ham radio operation for awhile now.  
This weekend band conditions were poor so I was dreaming of having a more expensive 
and better amp/antenna setup.  This was a great excuse to give RemoteHams.Com a try.  
After signing up and installing the Remote Client software I was presented with 100s 
of rigs to choose from from all over the World.  I was amazed.
